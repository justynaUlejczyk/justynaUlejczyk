- ⚡ Fun fact: There’s a galaxy made almost entirely of dark matter! 🌌👀
It's called Dragonfly 44, and about 99.99% of its mass is invisible. Scientists discovered
it in 2016 and were shocked because it behaves like a normal galaxy but barely has any stars!
It’s still a mystery how it formed. 🕵️‍♂️✨(this fact was generetated by AI)
Now something from me: Generative Ai, like ChatGPT can hallucinate and show incorrect information in very believable way👀.
